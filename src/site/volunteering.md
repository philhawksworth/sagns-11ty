# Volunteers can help in one or more of the following sections:-

* [Duty Officers](/a-duty-officers-day) – process the telephone requests and find a suitable volunteer for the client.  The Duty Officers work from home and are usually on duty - one day per month, their office documentation and stationery is portable and they transfer it to the next day’s Duty Officer after office hours. You can read about a duty officer's [typical day](/a-duty-officers-day).
* Bag Movers – kindly transfer the bags for those Duty Officers who are unable to transfer the bags themselves.  Usually about 14 transfers required each - month, therefore frequency for each volunteer is about once every other month.
* Transport – volunteers use their own cars to transport clients usually in and around St Albans, but sometimes further afield.  About half of the - journeys involve taking clients to hospital appointments, a quarter are social e.g. family visits, shopping expeditions and community centres, the - remainder are classified as medical, i.e. doctors surgeries, dentists, opticians, clinics etc.
* Regular Shopping – volunteers provide help with shopping, relieve carers and collect prescriptions usually for those clients who are housebound.
* Practical Help – volunteers handle heavier jobs around the home, e.g. moving furniture, minor repairs, decorating and gardening.
* Befriending – volunteers visit the elderly in their own homes about once a week, to provide companionship and a chat when needed.
