## **Coronavirus**

Here at the St Albans Good Neighbour Scheme the wellbeing of our volunteers and clients is our top priority. We are taking this unprecedented situation very seriously and giving updated advice to our volunteers, based on government and Public Health England advice, but also taking particular account of our clients' vulnerability.

## Our Services During the Coronavirus Crisis

We may be able to provide help with all kinds of things, including

* Shopping
* Collecting Prescriptions
* Practical Help, in certain circumstances - please call to discuss
* Befriending (no new referrals until further notice)
* Lifts to urgent medical appointments

Please note that our services are subject to change in the event of local or national lockdown restrictions.

We are delighted to announce that we have been awarded a grant from Hertfordshire Community Foundation towards the additional costs of our services during the Coronavirus crisis.

To find out more about all our activities this year, please read our informative and lively [Annual Report 2019-20](/assets/SAGNS-2020-ANNUAL-REPORT.pdf). Due to Covid-19 restrictions we held our AGM in November remotely, but all the reports our Section Leaders would have delivered in person can be read in this Report.

## Our Volunteers

We always need volunteers to help with the following roles and activities:

#### Duty Officer

#### Regular Shopping

#### Practical Help
