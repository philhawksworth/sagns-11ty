## Thinking of using the Scheme?

#### Q. Who can use the St Albans Good Neighbour Scheme?

A. Anyone who is elderly, unwell, lonely, disabled or facing a crisis and living in the St Albans district.

#### Q. How do I contact you to request help?

A. Ring our Helpline {{ values.phone }} between 9am and 1pm any day of the year. You will be put through to our Duty Officer.

#### Q. How much do you charge?

A. We do not ‘charge’ those that use the Scheme but the drivers carry a collection box in their cars and we ask clients to make a donation as we are entirely dependent on voluntary contributions.

#### Q. How much notice do I need to give when requesting help?

A. Please give us notice of a week or more if possible for medical appointments, etc.  However, we will always try to assist however short the notice.

#### Q. Can you take me to a hospital in London?

A. We are unable to drive clients to London hospitals but we would hope to be able to find a volunteer to accompany a client, using public transport or a taxi.  The client, in this instance, would normally be expected to pay the volunteer’s fare as well as their own.

#### Q. How often can I use the Scheme?

A. Clients are usually limited to two requests for help a month, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

## Thinking of volunteering with the Scheme?

#### Q. How do I apply to be a Volunteer?

A. You can fill in the [online volunteer application form](/2020-03-25-st-albans-good-neighbour-scheme/) or submit your details by filling out our [volunteer application form](/assets/volunteer-form.docx) or telephone our Helpline {{ values.phone }} to speak to a Duty Officer who will pass your details to our Volunteer Coordinator.

#### Q. Do I need any qualifications or experience?

A. No, our volunteers come from all walks of life and range from students to those in their 80’s.  A friendly manner and a willingness to help others is all you need.

#### Q. How much time do I need to give?

A. Volunteering with SAGNS is extremely flexible. Whether you can offer a couple of hours now and then or a couple of days a week, we would be very grateful for your help.  Duty Officers usually give a day a month (weekday or weekend) but as little as an hour or two now and then can be enough to provide valuable help to other sections of the Scheme.

#### Q. Can expenses be reclaimed?

A. Reimbursement for mileage, currently (40 pence per mile) and telephone calls (15 pence per call) are offered.

#### Q. When would I meet other volunteers?

A. Coffee mornings and tea parties are held for all volunteers, as well as an AGM each November.   Newsletters are sent out three times a year to keep everyone in touch. Volunteers are encouraged to contact the Section Leaders or Committee members if they encounter any problems.

#### Q. Would I be required to raise money for the Scheme?

A. No, our volunteers help people directly - one to one - by providing transport, doing shopping or odd jobs, befriending, etc.
